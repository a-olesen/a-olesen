## Hi there!

My name is Ashley and I'm going to school for Graphic Info Technology! I like going to the gym and don't really have time for much else between that, my job, and school, haha. I don't have a lot of tech skills yet but I'm eager to learn and having a great time so far. :)

I don't have any other accounts to share but maybe sometime! ðŸ˜­
